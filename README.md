# Voting dApp: Participatory Budgeting

We aim to develop a robust and user-friendly dApp for participatory budgeting, leveraging the advantages of blockchain technology to enhance transparency, security, and inclusivity in the budget allocation process.
Our dApp allows community members to propose budget allocations and citizens to vote on proposed projects using blockchain technology.

### Motivations

Traditional budgeting methods lack of transparency and inclusivity, leading to decisions that may not fully reflect the needs and priorities of citizens. The role of our dApp is to empower democracies: empower citizens to engage more directly in decision-making to create more inclusive and responsive political systems. Also, relying on blockchain technology ensure better security of voting.
