# Voting dApp: Participatory Budgeting

### Project Description

Our project aims to develop a user-friendly dApp for participatory budgeting, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparent and inclusive fund allocation. By enabling administrators to propose projects and citizens to vote without disclosing budget details, we promote democratic decision-making. Traditional budgeting methods often lack transparency and citizen engagement, which our dApp addresses by providing a secure platform. Through blockchain, we enhance process integrity, fostering trust and accountability. Ultimately, our streamlined approach empowers communities to prioritize projects based on merit, leading to more responsive and inclusive political systems.
